Angus McKinnon Young (born 31 March 1955) is an Australian guitarist, best known as the co-founder, lead guitarist, songwriter and only remaining original member of the Australian hard rock band AC/DC. He is known for his energetic performances, schoolboy-uniform stage outfits and his own version of Chuck Berry's duckwalk. Young was ranked 24th in Rolling Stone magazine's 100 greatest guitarists of all-time list.[3] With his older brother Malcolm Young's departure from the band in 2014, Angus became the only founding member still with AC/DC.

In 2003, Young and the other members of AC/DC were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
William Young (born February 16, 1911) and his family lived at 6 Skerryvore Road in the Cranhill district of Glasgow in Scotland.[4] William worked first as a wheel boy in a rope works and then as a machine / saw operator in an asbestos / cement business. In 1940 William joined the Royal Air Force serving in World War 2 as a flight engine mechanic. After the war William worked as a yard man for a builder and then as a postman. His wife Margaret (born July 14, 1913, her maiden name was also Young) was a housewife.[4]

The 'big freeze' of 1963 was the worst winter on record in Scotland with snow eight feet deep.[5] A TV advertisement at the same time offered assisted travel for families for a different life in Australia.[5] 15 members of the Young family left Scotland by aeroplane in late June 1963[5] including fifth son, George (6 November 1946 – 22 October 2017), and younger brothers, Malcolm (January 6, 1953 – November 18, 2017) and Angus.[4][5] Also aboard were his eldest brother Stephen (June 24, 1933 – 1989), his only sister, Mrs Margaret Horsburgh (born May 2, 1935) and brother, William Jr (born December 15, 1940).[6]:6–7 Another elder brother, Alex (December 28, 1938 – 1997), stayed in the UK, and was later a member of London-based group, Grapefruit.[7]:6–7 A final brother, John Young (born May 17, 1937), had migrated to Australia separately.[6]:6–7 Malcolm later described the family's musical background, "All the males in our family played, Stevie, the oldest played accordion, Alex and John were the first couple to play guitar, and being older it was sort of passed down to George, then myself, then Angus."[6]:6–7 His oldest brother Stevie was the father of Stevie Young who in later years took over from Malcolm in AC/DC.[8]

Initially staying at Villawood Migrant Hostel (a site later developed as Villawood Immigration Detention Centre) in Nissen huts, George Young met and became friends with another migrant, Harry Vanda.[5] The Young family moved into a semi detached house at 4 Burleigh Street in the Sydney suburb of Burwood.[9]

He dropped out of Ashfield Boys High School at age 15.[10] Young first started playing on a banjo, re-strung with six strings.[7] He first started playing guitar on a cheap acoustic model purchased second-hand by his mother. 

Angus Young was 18 when he and older brother Malcolm formed AC/DC in 1973. Angus was on lead guitar, Malcolm on rhythm guitar, Colin Burgess on drums, Larry Van Kriedt on bass guitar and Dave Evans on vocals.[7] "Can I Sit Next To You Girl," their first single, was later re-recorded with Bon Scott as their vocalist.[7] They decided upon the name AC/DC after seeing the letters "AC/DC" on the back of their sister Margaret's sewing machine.[13]

Young tried a number of stage costumes, such as Spider-Man, Zorro, a gorilla, and a parody of Superman, named Super-Ang,[14] before settling on his signature schoolboy look at the suggestion of his sister. To match this image the press and public were told that Young was born in 1959, not 1955. The original uniform was created by his sister Margaret and when it fell apart from wear and tear, he used his uniform from Ashfield Boys High School in Sydney.[7] "I don't like to play above or below people's heads. Basically, I just like to get up in front of a crowd and rip it up."[15]

AC/DC released their debut album, High Voltage, on 17 February 1975. Over the next 3 years AC/DC cemented themselves as a popular hard rock act, especially in Australia, with the follow-up albums, T.N.T., Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap, Let There Be Rock and Powerage. All their albums until this point were produced by Young's brother George and Harry Vanda in partnership.[5] Their 1979 studio album, Highway to Hell, became their best-selling at the time and launched them to new heights of fame.

Months after this, Scott died from alcohol poisoning. Questions were raised as to whether the band could continue without him.[7] Young and his other bandmates soon decided they should finish the work they had begun for their new album, so they recruited ex-Geordie singer Brian Johnson to replace Scott. Five months later, Back in Black was released as a tribute to Scott.[7] It quickly became a huge success, far out-selling any of their previous albums, and going on to reach 22x multi-platinum in the US alone, and selling 50 million copies, the second highest-selling album worldwide, behind only Michael Jackson's Thriller. AC/DC's next album, For Those About to Rock We Salute You, cemented their position as the most popular hard rock act of the time.

AC/DC's popularity declined with the mediocre success of their next 3 albums, Flick of the Switch, Fly on the Wall and Blow Up Your Video. AC/DC looked as though they had reached their peak early in the decade and by the end of it were in decline.[7] Malcolm Young missed the majority of AC/DC's Blow Up Your Video World Tour to address his alcohol problem.[7] He eventually became sober and returned to the band. During his absence he was replaced by his nephew, Stevie Young.

However, their 1990 studio album, The Razors Edge, brought them back into the spotlight, reaching 5x multi-platinum in the US alone and selling between 10 and 12 million copies worldwide.[7] Over the next 10 years AC/DC released two other studio albums, Ballbreaker and Stiff Upper Lip, which confirmed their renewed popularity and success. After a lengthy eight-year hiatus, AC/DC returned with a new studio album, Black Ice. Black Ice debuted at number 1 in 29 countries and was certified multi-platinum in 14 of those, becoming one of their most successful albums worldwide, and was followed by a hugely successful world tour. In 2010, AC/DC released an album of songs used for the Iron Man 2 soundtrack they had put together; this reached number 1 in many countries around the world, including the UK, and number 4 in the US. Malcolm Young confirmed in 2011 that AC/DC were working on a 16th studio album.

In April 2014 Malcolm Young was forced to leave the band due to ill health, leaving Angus the last consistent member in the band. In May it was revealed that Stevie Young, Malcolm and Angus's nephew, would stand in for his uncle to record AC/DC's latest record. In September Malcolm officially retired and Stevie was made AC/DC's official full-time rhythm guitarist. AC/DC released Rock or Bust in the fall of 2014. In March 2016, after already seeing the departure of both long term guitarist Malcolm Young and drummer Phil Rudd, AC/DC was set back with yet another departure; long time lead singer Brian Johnson was ordered by doctors to stop performing or face total hearing loss. Angus, determined to finish what the band started, recruited Guns N' Roses singer Axl Rose to stand in for Brian for the remainder of the Rock or Bust World Tour. It is unknown what Angus has planned for the band after the tour; however, Axl Rose has expressed interest in staying on board for however long Angus needs him.

In 2003, AC/DC were inducted into the Rock and Roll hall of fame and the following year they were ranked number 72 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the "100 greatest artists of all time." VH1 ranked them number 23 on their list of the "100 greatest artists of all time" and number 4 in their list of the "100 greatest artists of hard rock."
